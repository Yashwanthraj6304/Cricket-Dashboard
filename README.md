#Cricket dashboard
This project is an interactive dashboard built using HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly.js.
It allows users to upload a local JSON dataset and automatically generates insightful visualizations that help analyze performance trends.

Although designed from match data originally (IPL format), the structure works effectively for any dataset that includes:

Team performance

Wins and losses

Victory margins

Toss impact

Player of the match or top performer metrics

The dashboard generates the following five analytics:

1️⃣ Wins by Team

Displays total number of wins for each team to understand dominance and competitiveness.

2️⃣ Wins by Season

Shows performance across seasons to identify year-wise strength and trends.

3️⃣ Toss Decision Impact

Compares whether winning the toss influences winning the match.

4️⃣ Victory Margin Distribution

Shows distribution of wins based on:

Runs

Wickets

Helps understand whether matches are closely contested or heavily one-sided.

5️⃣ Player of the Match Analysis

Displays top performers based on number of “Player of the Match” awards.
